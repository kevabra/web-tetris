When replacing FrontEnd React with purely vanilla html, css, and jss, still must have the static html files deployed on a server (locally, it will be localhost).

To do this:

To ensure your static HTML files run correctly on localhost, you can use a simple static file server. Here's how you can set it up using a few different methods:

1. Using a Simple Static File Server (Node.js)
You can use the http-server package, which is a simple way to serve static files:

Install http-server globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g http-server
Navigate to your frontend directory where your static HTML files are located.

Start the server:

bash
Copy code
http-server
By default, this will serve your files at http://localhost:8080. You can specify a different port if needed:

bash
Copy code
http-server -p 5000
